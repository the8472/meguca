##Runtime dependencies
* [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) >= 9.5

##Building from source
A reference list of commands can be found in `docs/installation.md`

###Dependencies
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >=1.7
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >=5.0
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
* clang and LLVM >= 3.9
* make
* pkg-config
* pthread
* lzma
* ffmpeg >= 3.0 libraries (libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat) compiled with:
    * libvpx
    * libvorbis
    * libopus
    * libtheora
    * libx264
    * libmp3lame
* GraphicsMagick compiler with:
    * zlib
    * libpng
    * libjpeg
    * postscript
* git
* zip

###Linux and OSX
* Run `make`

###Windows
* Install [MSYS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/)
* Open MSYS2 shell
* Install dependencies listed above with the `mingw-w64-x86_64-` prefix with
pacman
* Navigate to the meguca root directory
* Run `make`

##Setup
* See `./meguca help` for server operation
* Login into the "admin" account via the infinity symbol in the top banner with
the password "password"
* Change the default password
* Create a board from the administration panel
* Configure server from the administration panel

##Development
* See `/docs/` for more documentation
* `./meguca` or `./meguca debug` run the server in development mode
* `make server` and `make client` build the server and client separately
* `make watch` watches the file system for changes and incrementally rebuilds
the client
* `make update_deps` updates all dependencies
* `make clean` removes files from the previous compilation
* `make dist_clean` in addition to the above removes uploaded files and their
thumbnails

###Linux only
* make creates a Go workspace in the `.build` subdirectory. If you don't have a
proper Go workspace set up, you can simply `export GOPATH=$(pwd)/.build` to
temporarily assign `.build` as your Go workspace in the current shell. This will
allow you to use native go commands such as `go test` and `go build`.
